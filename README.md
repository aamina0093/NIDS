# NIDS

The Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is built using machine learning concepts. This system includes datasets and algorithms which will analyze the network security of the system. 

The system will deal with the attacks by dividing them into four categories namely DoS, Probe, U2R, and R2L and are trained and tested by KDD training and testing datasets. 

The datasets processed will be used by three algorithmns: Random Forest, SVM and KNN algorithms.The algorithms provide results in the form of Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F-mearure. 

Ensemble Learning process is used to combine the result obtained from the algorithms and generated and average data that will be considered as a final result obtaines from the system.
